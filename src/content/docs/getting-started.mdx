The Web Components Toolkit is a collection of tools to help you build web components that teams love to use. 
This guide will help you get started with the tools used in the Toolkit.

## Custom Elements Manifest (CEM)

Most of the tools in the WC Toolkit are built using the [Custom Elements Manifest (CEM)](https://github.com/webcomponents/custom-elements-manifest), 
which is a schema used used to document the APIs for your components. 
There are a few ways to generate a CEM for your components. 
Most of the tools in this library are agnostic to which tool used, but there are some tools that 
are specific to an analyzer as they utilize their features to add value for the manifest.
