This tool maps inherited content (including class members, attributes, CSS parts, CSS variables, slots, and events) from parent components in the Custom Elements Manifest (CEM). 
This helps in maintaining a clear and comprehensive documentation of web components and their inheritance hierarchy and reduces the need for duplicate documentation for component with shared APIs.

## Installation

To install the package, use the following command:

```bash
npm install @wc-toolkit/cem-inheritance
```

## Usage

This package includes two ways to update the Custom Elements Manifest:

1. using it in a script
2. as a plugin for the [Custom Element Manifest Analyzer](https://custom-elements-manifest.open-wc.org/).

### Script

```js
// my-script.js

import { updateCemInheritance } from "@wc-toolkit/cem-inheritance";
import manifest from "./path/to/custom-elements.json" with { type: 'json' };

const options = {...};

updateCemInheritance(manifest, options);
```

### CEM Analyzer

The plugin can be added to the [Custom Elements Manifest Analyzer configuration file](https://custom-elements-manifest.open-wc.org/analyzer/config/#config-file).

```js
// custom-elements-manifest.config.js

import { cemInheritancePlugin } from "@wc-toolkit/cem-inheritance";

const options = {...};

export default {
  /** Enable this if you are extending a third-party library */
  dependencies: true,
  plugins: [
    cemInheritancePlugin(options)
  ],
};
```

  </a>
</div>

## Configuration

There are a number of configurations you can apply to customize the output for your components.

```ts
type CemInheritanceOptions = {
  /** Name of the updated CEM file - default is "custom-elements.json" */
  fileName?: string;
  /** Path to output directory */
  outdir?: string;
  /** Class names of any components you would like to exclude from inheritance */
  exclude?: string[];
  /** Omit items from inheritance based on a custom CEM property */
  omitByProperty?: OmittedProperties;
  /** Omit items from inheritance based on CEM Analyzer plugin config */
  omitByConfig?: ConfigOmit;
  /** Skip inheritance for an aspect of your components */
  ignore?: string[];
  /** External CEMs that your components extend */
  externalManifests?: unknown[];
  /** Include external manifest declarations in your manifest */
  includeExternalManifests?: boolean;
  /** Shows process logs */
  debug?: boolean;
  /** Prevents plugin from executing */
  skip?: boolean;
};
```

## Omitting APIs

If there are any parts of your parent classes you do not want to have inherited, you can have them omitted from the component.

There are two ways to exclude them:

1. setting a configuration in the options
1. using custom properties in the Custom Elements Manifest

<Aside>This does not remove the feature from the component, it only removes it from the Custom Elements Manifest.</Aside>

### Omit By Config

The first way to omit an API is by using the `omitByConfig` setting. 
This allows you to specify a class name and any aspect of the inherited members can include a string array of the name of the feature to be excluded.
This is useful if you do not have direct access to the components.

```ts
const options = {
  omitByConfig: {
    MyElement: {
      cssProperties: ["--my-css-property"],
      events: ["my-event", "my-other-event"],
    },
  },
};
```

### Omit By Property
The second way to omit an API is by using the `omitByProperty` setting.
This allows you to specify a property name in the Custom Elements Manifest that contains a string array of the name of the item you would like to omit.

Here are the default property names:

```ts
const defaultOmittedProperties: OmittedProperties = {
  cssProperties: "omitCssProps",
  cssParts: "omitCssParts",
  cssStates: "omitCssStates",
  methods: "omitMethods",
  attributes: "omit",
  properties: "omit",
  events: "omitEvents",
  slots: "omitSlots",
};
```

### Using JSDoc Tags

_If you are using the CEM Analyzer_, you can use custom JSDoc tags to omit inherited APIs.

```ts
/**
 * Component where items are omitted from the JSDoc tags
 *
 * @tag my-jsdoc-omit-component
 *
 * @omit age - this will work for properties and attributes
 * @omit-cssprop --property-name
 * @omit-cssState state-name
 * @omit-event event-name
 * @omit-method methodName
 * @omit-part part-name
 * @omit-slot slot-name
 * 
 */
```
import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

## Setting Output Targets

If you would like to add your updated Custom Elements Manifest to a specific location in your project, you can use the `fileName` and `outdir` setting for that. 
Otherwise, the updated manifest will be default location - `./custom-elements.json`.

<Aside>If you are using the CEM Analyzer, you do not need to set these options. It will allow the analyzer to handle it based on your configuration.</Aside>

## Excluding Components

If there are any classes you would like to exclude from inheritance, you can specify the class names in the `exclude` string array.

```ts
const options = {
  exclude: ["MyInternalElement", "MySubElement"],
};
```


## Excluding APIs

Some CEM generators will already handle some aspects of the inheritance for you or you may want to exclude an aspect of the inheritance and manage it yourself. 
If that's the case, you can use the `ignore` setting to skip an area of inheritance.

```ts
const options = {
  ignore: ["attributes", "members"],
};
```

## Including External Manifests

If your components are being extended from an existing library, you can import that library's manifest and add it to the `externalManifests` array. 
You can add as many manifest to this as you need. 
The external manifest's components will not be added to your manifest, but only update the information for your components.

```ts
import externalCEM from "path/to/external/custom-elements.json" with { type: "json" };

const options = {
  externalManifests: [externalCEM],
};
```

## Including External Manifest Declarations

If you want to include the actual component declarations from external manifests in your final manifest (not just use them for inheritance), you can use the `includeExternalManifests` option along with `externalManifests`.

```ts
import externalCEM from "path/to/external/custom-elements.json" with { type: "json" };

const options = {
  externalManifests: [externalCEM],
  includeExternalManifests: true,
};
```

When `includeExternalManifests` is set to `true`, the external manifest's module information will be included in your final manifest file. 
This is useful when you want to create a comprehensive manifest that includes both your components and their parent components from external libraries.

<Aside>When using `includeExternalManifests: true`, make sure the external manifests don't conflict with your own component declarations.</Aside>
