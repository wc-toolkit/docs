This tool is designed to validate key aspects of your project to ensure accurate documentation and proper integration with tools.

You may not be using all of the features identified in these test scenarios, but they are in place to also raise awareness to features that may help your implementation.


## Installation

To install the package, use the following command:

```bash
npm install -D @wc-toolkit/cem-validator
```

## Usage

This package includes two ways to update the Custom Elements Manifest:

1. using it in a script
2. as a plugin for the [Custom Element Manifest Analyzer](https://custom-elements-manifest.open-wc.org/).

### Script

```ts
// my-script.ts

import { validateCem, type CemValidatorOptions } from "@wc-toolkit/cem-validator";
import manifest from "./path/to/custom-elements.json" with { type: 'json' };

const options: CemValidatorOptions = {...};

validateCem(manifest, options);
```

### CEM Analyzer

The plugin can be added to the [Custom Elements Manifest Analyzer configuration file](https://custom-elements-manifest.open-wc.org/analyzer/config/#config-file).

```js
// custom-elements-manifest.config.js

import { cemValidatorPlugin } from "@wc-toolkit/cem-validator";

const options = {...};

export default {
  plugins: [
    cemValidatorPlugin(options)
  ],
};
```

## Configuration

```ts
type CemValidatorOptions = {
  /** The path to the `package.json` file */
  packageJsonPath?: string;
  /** Custom Elements Manifest file name */
  cemFileName?: string;
  /** This will log errors rather throw an exception */
  logErrors?: boolean;
  /** Enables logging during the component loading process */
  debug?: boolean;
  /** Prevents plugin from executing */
  skip?: boolean;
  /** Rule configurations */
  rules?: Rules;
};

/** The severity level for each rule */
type Severity = "off" | "warning" | "error";

type Rules = {
  /** Checks if the package.json file is appropriately configured */
  packageJson?: {
    /** Is `type` property set to "module" */
    packageType?: Severity;
    /** Is `main` property set with a valid file path */
    main?: Severity;
    /** Is `module` property set with a valid file path */
    module?: Severity;
    /** Is `types` property set with a valid file path */
    types?: Severity;
    /** Does the package have a `exports` property configured */
    exports?: Severity;
    /** Is the `customElements` property properly configured */
    customElementsProperty?: Severity;
    /** Is the Custom Elements Manifest included in the published package */
    publishedCem?: Severity;
  }
  /** Checks if the Custom Elements Manifest is valid */
  manifest?: {
    /** Is the manifest using the latest schema version */
    schemaVersion?: Severity;
    /** Does the component have a valid module path */
    modulePath?: Severity;
    /** Does the component have a valid definition path */
    definitionPath?: Severity;
    /** Does the element have a valid type definition path */
    typeDefinitionPath?: Severity;
    /** Does the component export all necessary types */
    exportTypes?: Severity;
    /** Does the component have a tag name defined */
    tagName?: Severity;
  }
};
```
### Options

- `packageJsonPath`: The path to the `package.json` file. This will look for the `package.json` file in the specified path. If not provided, it will look for the `package.json` file in the current working directory.
- `cemFileName`: The name of the Custom Elements Manifest file. This can be used if the file is not named `custom-elements.json`.
- `logErrors`: If set to `true`, errors will be logged instead of throwing an exception. This is useful for debugging.
- `debug`: If set to `true`, debug information will be logged during the component loading process. This is useful for debugging.
- `skip`: If set to `true`, the plugin will not execute. For performance reasons, it might be useful to only enable this during build and not watching during development.
- `rules`: An object containing the rules to validate. Each rule can be set to `off`, `warning`, or `error`. The default is `error`.

## Rules

Each of the rules can be configured to be `off`, `warning`, or `error`.

- `off`: The rule is disabled.
- `warning`: The rule will log a warning message if it fails.
- `error`: The validator will throw an exception for all failed tests.

### Package.json Rules

#### `moduleType`

Checks if the `package.json` file has the `type` property set to `module`. 
This is important for ensuring that the package is treated as an ES module.

More information about this rule can be found [here](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#type).

#### `main`

Checks if the `package.json` file has the `main` property set with a valid file path. 

More information about this rule can be found [here](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#main).

#### `module`

Checks if the `package.json` file has the `module` property set with a valid file path. 
This is important to ensure the package can be imported correctly for projects using ES module syntax.

More information about this rule can be found [here](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#module).

#### `types`

Checks if the `package.json` file has the `types` property set with a valid file path. 
This is important for ensuring that the types can be appropriately referenced.

More information about this rule can be found [here](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#community-conditions-definitions).

#### `exports`

Checks if the `package.json` file has the `exports` property configured. This is important for ensuring that the package can be imported correctly with type definitions.

More information about this rule can be found [here](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#exports).

#### `customElementsProperty`

Checks if the `package.json` file has the `customElements` property configured. 
This makes it easier for tools to find the manifest.

More information about this rule can be found [here](https://github.com/webcomponents/custom-elements-manifest?tab=readme-ov-file#referencing-manifests-from-npm-packages).

#### `publishedCem`

Checks if the Custom Elements Manifest is included in the final package.
This is important for ensuring that the manifest is available for tools to use.
If you are not specifying the `files` property in your `package.json`, it should be included by default.

More information about this rule can be found [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/configuring-npm/package-json?v=true#files).

### Manifest Rules

#### `schemaVersion`

Checks if the `custom-elements.json` file has the `schemaVersion` property set to the latest version. 
This is important for ensuring that the manifest is using the latest schema version.

More information about this rule can be found [here](https://github.com/webcomponents/custom-elements-manifest?tab=readme-ov-file#schema-versioning).

#### `modulePath`

Checks if the `custom-elements.json` file has the path to the file where the component logic exists. 
This is important for ensuring that tools can locate and import your components correctly.

For help updating this, check out the [Module Path Resolver package](/documentation/module-path-resolver/).

#### `definitionPath`

Checks if the `custom-elements.json` file has the path to the file where the component is defined (`customElements.define(...)`). 
This is important for ensuring that tools can locate and import the component definition correctly.

For help updating this, check out the [Module Path Resolver package](/documentation/module-path-resolver/).

#### `typeDefinitionPath`

Checks if the `custom-elements.json` file has the path to the file where the component type definitions exist.
This will only be tested if the `typeDefinitionPath` is set in the `custom-elements.json` file for a module.

This is only relevant if you types are not co-located with your components of if your types follow a different naming conventions from your component modules.

For help updating this, check out the [Module Path Resolver package](/documentation/module-path-resolver/).

#### `exportTypes`

Checks if the types used by your component's public APIs are properly exported.

#### `tagName`

Checks if the component has a tag name defined.
This is important as it is often used to identify components in the CEM.
If they are not defined, you can add one by using the `@tag` or `@tagName` JSDoc tags to the component's class JSDoc.

More information about this rule can be found [here](https://custom-elements-manifest.open-wc.org/analyzer/getting-started/#supported-jsdoc).
